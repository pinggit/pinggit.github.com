according to
<https://raw.github.com/victorstanciu/Wikitten/master/library/Sample%20Markdown%20document.md>
markdown toc can be written (manually) like this:

    * [event time lines](#event_time_lines)
    * [boot/reseat/crash sequence](#bootreseatcrash_sequence)
    * [logs](#logs)
    * [show reboot](#show_reboot)

tested and works (at least in github/rdiscount)

rules of the thumbs:
* replace space with `_`
* ignore `/`
