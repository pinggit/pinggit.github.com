I just realized, that DOS(window7) does not looks that bad...  so put it this
way, without installing ANY other software, just give me :

* Internet access
* Internet Explorer( or any other popular web browser) for VPN setup
* dos windows

I can work in full [[efficiency]] now, just like as if I'm seating/working in the
office:
