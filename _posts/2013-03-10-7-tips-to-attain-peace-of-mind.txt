== 7 Tips to Attain Peace of Mind

http://xue.youdao.com/article.z?id=-7514447938861046657&keyfrom=PopWindow&abtest=1[有道学堂]

When you were child you had a pure mind; the mind which was free from worries
and anxieties. As the time passed, you were influenced by several social,
personal, familial and official crises such as financial complications, broken
relationship, lack of trust, joblessness, failure in business, loss of respect
and so on. When the mind is stressful, the associated germs of negativity,
jealousy and pessimism add fuel to fire and hence your pure mind becomes
impure. These impurities if taken out can bring back the mental purity hence
real spirit of joy of childhood can be attained up to an adequate level. Off
course you cannot fix all of your problem at once but you can train your mind
to develop the skills which can help either bypass or overcome the depressed
and tragic situations so as to give you a big time relaxation while you focus
on the solution to your problems. Below are some techniques which can be used
to combat the peace stealing triggers:

1.     Mind your own business.
Yes, please mind your own business. When you start being concerned about things
which are not related to you, you lose your grip on your thought process which
often results in negativity disturbing the mental peace.  Basically, your mind
starts wandering here and there. As you know that a non-focused mind is evil*s
workshop hence the germs of negativity and jealousy gain more strength. So next
time an unnecessary thought comes to your mind, think whether this is really
something you should be worrying for? If not, shun it right away and focus on
something positive, practical and fruitful.

2.     Surround yourself in positive people.
Ignore negative comments and stay away from negative souls. When someone is
negative, he spreads negativity and you get affected. Permanently staying with
such people will have long term impact on your character so think about your
company.
3. *Don\*t think about others too much.*
+
Remember the great quote: small minds discuss people; Average minds discuss
events; Higher minds discuss ideas and Great minds act in silence. Don*t allow
your brain to compare yourself to others as this is an insult to yourself.
Don*t be Jealous; it*s a heart killing disease, get rid of it as soon as
possible. When you are jealous you focus on finding faults in others even if
they don't have. This poisons your soul and steals the mental peace.

4. *You can\*t keep everyone happy.*
+
Don*t be over sensitive. Be natural and genuine in what you do. Be positive,
constructive and ethical in your deeds and then don*t really care too much
about others. Be aware, don*t apply this formula to too closed relations.
Develop trust to establish powerful relationships.

5. *Control your mood swings as it is an indication of unstable personality.*
+
Do it by not being over sensitive to others. Stop being reactive and implosive.
Stay calm.

6. *Ignore your thoughts about being unlucky.*
+
Bad luck happens to everyone.  It*s not your fault at all. Time whether good or
bad, passes quickly.  Develop the power of not looking back into your past.
Believe in the power of Now. Believe in your skills. Work hard and have faith
in God; you will get what you have been entitled for. Be patient and see what
God has planned for you. Patience and consistency in your deeds is the key to
success.

7. *Simplicity in your character and living style can overcome the stress and
improve your happiness index.*
+    
Don*t be socially sensitive and start following every single trend your social
circle is following.

With these recommendations, I believe you can bring major changes in your life
style hence attain back your mental peace. What are your recommendations in
gaining mental peace?

== 7 Tips to Attain Peace of Mind

http://xue.youdao.com/article.z?id=-7514447938861046657&keyfrom=PopWindow&abtest=1[有道学堂]

When you were child you had a pure mind; the mind which was free from worries
and anxieties. As the time passed, you were influenced by several social,
personal, familial and official crises such as financial complications, broken
relationship, lack of trust, joblessness, failure in business, loss of respect
and so on. When the mind is stressful, the associated germs of negativity,
jealousy and pessimism add fuel to fire and hence your pure mind becomes
impure. These impurities if taken out can bring back the mental purity hence
real spirit of joy of childhood can be attained up to an adequate level. Off
course you cannot fix all of your problem at once but you can train your mind
to develop the skills which can help either bypass or overcome the depressed
and tragic situations so as to give you a big time relaxation while you focus
on the solution to your problems. Below are some techniques which can be used
to combat the peace stealing triggers:

1.  *Mind your own business.*
+
Yes, please mind your own business. When you start being concerned about things
which are not related to you, you lose your grip on your thought process which
often results in negativity disturbing the mental peace.  Basically, your mind
starts wandering here and there. As you know that a non-focused mind is evil*s
workshop hence the germs of negativity and jealousy gain more strength. So next
time an unnecessary thought comes to your mind, think whether this is really
something you should be worrying for? If not, shun it right away and focus on
something positive, practical and fruitful.

2. Surround yourself in positive people. 

Ignore negative comments and stay away from negative souls. When someone is
negative, he spreads negativity and you get affected. Permanently staying with
such people will have long term impact on your character so think about your
company.

3. Don*t think about others too much. 

Remember the great quote: small minds discuss people; Average minds discuss
events; Higher minds discuss ideas and Great minds act in silence. Don*t allow
your brain to compare yourself to others as this is an insult to yourself.
Don*t be Jealous; it*s a heart killing disease, get rid of it as soon as
possible. When you are jealous you focus on finding faults in others even if
they don't have. This poisons your soul and steals the mental peace.

4. You can*t keep everyone happy. 

Don*t be over sensitive. Be natural and genuine in what you do. Be positive,
constructive and ethical in your deeds and then don*t really care too much
about others. Be aware, don*t apply this formula to too closed relations.
Develop trust to establish powerful relationships.

5. Control your mood swings as it is an indication of unstable personality. 

Do it by not being over sensitive to others. Stop being reactive and implosive.
Stay calm.

6. Ignore your thoughts about being unlucky. 

Bad luck happens to everyone.  It*s not your fault at all. Time whether good or
bad, passes quickly.  Develop the power of not looking back into your past.
Believe in the power of Now. Believe in your skills. Work hard and have faith
in God; you will get what you have been entitled for. Be patient and see what
God has planned for you. Patience and consistency in your deeds is the key to
success.

7. Simplicity in your character and living style can overcome the stress and
improve your happiness index. 
    
Don*t be socially sensitive and start following every single trend your social
circle is following.

With these recommendations, I believe you can bring major changes in your life
style hence attain back your mental peace. What are your recommendations in
gaining mental peace?
