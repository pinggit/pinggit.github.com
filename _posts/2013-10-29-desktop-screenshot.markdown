pure text work related notes.  all notes are taken with VIM, plus VOom
plugin, highlighted with format of asciidoc syntax, from inside a GNU screen,
running over a SSH session to work PC from home:

a very old "ascii art" topology (2009 JNCIP learning?). I didn't know of any
ascii art tools (e.g. drawit,etc) at that time:

some ascii arts of network topology draw by VIM drawit plugin:

one good thing of writing text notes in asciidoc format is, that I can later
use the notes as input, and generate a lot of other type of document with more
decent formats , for example (all kinds of) webpage(s), pdf, or even MS word.
