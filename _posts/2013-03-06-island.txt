== island

Fri Sep 21 09:42:37 EDT 2012

China has begun 'cracking down' on violent 		打击 
'anti-Japan protests'. The two countries have been      [‘protɛst] 反日游行
'feuding' over control of a group of islands in        	*[fju:d]vi.长期不和,争执
the 'East China Sea'. And today, the man               	
expected to be China's next leader said Japan           隐指'习近平'
should, quote, " 'rein in' its behavior."         	*[rein]vt. 驾驭, 控制
But as Lucy Craft reports from Tokyo, many          
Japanese are 'shocked' about how the Chinese              
are behaving.

好东西: 

    the man expected to be ... ::
      被认为会是下一界领导人的那人... 怎么听都有嘲弄的味道, 不能直接说"XiJinPing"?

    'rein in' ::
      这词儿说出来个人感觉:有"霸气":请收敛, 请日本自重!
      Most of us know we should rein in our energy use. But to be
      successful, it’d help if we knew the best way to do it.
      很多人都知道应该严格控制能源消耗
      而掌握最佳的管控方法则能帮助我们成功做到这一点。

LUCY CRAFT: Japan and China 'normalized ties' 		恢复邦交正常化
40 years ago and in terms of economic            	
relations, are 'literally' 'joined at the hip';        	inseparable不可分
their 'cross-border trade' reaching $340 billion        跨境贸易
last year. Their political relationship,                
meanwhile, has been a constant +source+ of 'tension'.   [sɔ:s],无儿化   紧张
And 'yet while' anti-Japanese 'hostility' in China 	*[hɒs'tiliti] n. 敌意, 
has 'flared up' repeatedly over the years,              突然发怒；突然燃烧，骤然
the recent widespread 'fury' targeted at Japanese 	狂怒
government offices and businesses over the last
week, 'blindsided' many	here - like 			攻其不备[‘blaind'said]
72-year-old 'greengrocer' Hiroko Iwasaki. 		‘griːngrəʊsə] 菜贩

HIROKO IWASAKI: (Through translator) It 'escalated' 	传播
so fast.  I'm shocked. We are helpless, and it's        震惊
'awful'.                                           	可怕的
                                               
CRAFT: Businessman Kazunori Mutoh refused to  
believe the 'destruction' being 'wrought' in China,    work的过去式和过去分词
was truly 'fueled' by anti-Japanese 'hatred'.          [‘fjuəld]刺激(加燃料),引起 
'In a widely held view', he said that the              [‘ænttai] [‘heitrid]
government-approved protests gave the Chinese an                             
opportunity to 'vent'. 				       发泄                     

KAZUNORI MUTOH: (Through translator) The people                              
who are 'demonstrating' are actually expressing         游行示威[‘æktʃuəli]
dissatisfaction with their own government, against                           
their own country. So I feel no 'personal antagonism' 	n.对立,敌对, 敌意 
towards the Chinese people. 				*[æn'tægәnizm]

CRAFT: The violence across the East China Sea           
seems a world away from Japan, with its low 'crime rate'
and where political protest is still unusual,                          
says Michael Cucek, an independent political                                
analyst.                                                                    
                                                                            
MICHAEL CUCEK: One of the Japanese points of 'pride'    
is, we don't have demonstrations; we don't get          
excited; we don't go crazy. And it 'looks down upon' 	看不起
the Chinese - not only the government, but the                              
actual people of China - as being 'irrational',         *[i'ræʃәnәl] a.无理性的
'barbarians'. This is language that is commonly         *[bɑ:'bєәriәnz]n.野蛮人
used to describe Chinese.
                                                                           
CRAFT: I'm standing in front of the Chuen-Tei                              
Chinese restaurant in central Tokyo. It's a                                
typical weekday lunchtime. The restaurant's full        
of customers sitting down for their bowls of                               
noodles. It's 'business as usual'. Of course, if        正常营业
this were a Japanese restaurant in China, the           _if this 'were'_
'eatery' would probably be closed, covered with         *[’i:tәri]n.简便饮食店
signs expressing support for the Chinese                        
side in the 'islands dispute'. 				*[dis'pju:t] 岛屿之论                  
                                                                          
After finishing her lunch at the Chuen-Tei                                
restaurant, social worker Sayaka Onishi 'held out' 	坚持；伸出
'hope against hope', for a diplomatic solution.  	(绝望中)抱一线希望
                                                                          
SAYAKA ONISHI: (Through translator) Japanese are                          
generally a peaceful people, but every country has                        
its 'extreme elements'.  This 'calls for' 		极端分子.    需要,呼唤
'reconciliation' with the Chinese. I am                 [,rekənsili'eiʃən]
absolutely 'against the use of force'. 			n. 和解, 和好, 复交,
                                                      
CRAFT: Mutoh, the businessman, doesn't completely     
'buy' Japanese arguments that the tiny islands -        
which the U.S. occupied after World War II and
then handed back to Japan - have always been
Japanese property. Chinese claims date back
centuries.

MUTOH: (Through translator) Prime Minister Noda 	[’nəudə]野田
and others say historically, it's Japanese
'territory'. But I'm not so sure it was Japan's, if 	领土
you go back thousands of years. As far as recent
history is concerned, the U.S. declared it
Japanese territory after the war, and returned it
to us.

CRAFT: Because of its 'pacifist constitution', 		*[‘pæsifist]n.和平主义者 
military force is not an option for Japan in 		和平宪法(日本战败后)
'resolving' the Senkaku-Daiyou islands dispute - an 	'zɔl', not 'zou'
issue that may 'compel' the U.S., which is               *[kәm'pel] vt.强迫,迫使
'obligated' to defend Japanese territory, to step
in.

好东西:

    * pacifist constitution 
      日本发动战争战败,被永久限制军事配备 => 并有附加的解释:
      military force is NOT AN OPTION for JAPAN in ...

    * Senkaku-Daiyou islands dispute
      我们称为"钓鱼岛之争", 美国(国际?)的称呼确是"尖阁列岛之争"
      并且,日本现在还坚持"没有争议", no 'DISPUTE'

    * compel the US to
      迫使美国不得不... 好像美国真不愿意掺和似的...
      Nothing can compel me to do such a thing! - 这事儿哥绝对不会干!

    * obligated 有责任去...
      美日安保条例...美国的把戏
