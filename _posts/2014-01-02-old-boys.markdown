                        　　那是我日夜思念深深爱着的人呐        
                              　　到底我该如何表达                    
                                　　她会接受我吗                        
                        　　也许永远都不会跟她说出那句话        
                              　　注定我要浪迹天涯                    
                                　　怎么能有牵挂                        
                              　　梦想总是遥不可及                    
                               　　是不是应该放弃                      
                              　　花开花落又是一季                    
                               　　春天啊你在哪里                      
                             　　一去不回来不及道别                  
                       　　只剩下麻木的我没有了当年的热血      
                             　　看那漫天飘零的花朵                  
                             　　在最美丽的时刻凋谢                  
                           　　有谁会记得这世界她来过              
                              　　转眼过去多年世间                    
                                　　多少离合悲欢                        
                              　　曾经志在四方少年                    
                                　　羡慕南飞的雁                        
                        　　各自奔前程的身影匆匆渐行渐远        
                               　　未来在哪里平凡                      
                                　　啊谁给我答案                        
                       　　那时陪伴我的人啊你们如今在何方      
                       　　我曾经爱过的人啊现在是什么模样      
                             　　当初的愿望实现了吗                  
                             　　事到如今只好祭奠吗                  
                       　　任岁月风干理想再也找不回真的我      
                             　　抬头仰望这满天星河                  
                             　　那时候陪伴我的那颗                  
                           　　这里的故事你是否还记得              
                             　　生活像一把无情刻刀                  
                               　　改变了我们模样                      
                             　　未曾绽放就要枯萎吗                  
                                 　　我有过梦想                          
                             　　青春如同奔流的江河                  
                             　　一去不回来不及道别                  
                       　　只剩下麻木的我没有了当年的热血

                   I am deep in love with her, thinking of her day and night
                                  But how can I express myself
                                     And will she accept me
                            Maybe I'll never expose my heart to her
                       For I am always wondering about alone and homeless
                                  How can I be on tenterhooks
                                     Dreams are but dreams
                                     Maybe I should give up
                             Flowers bloom and fade again and again
          But where is the spring for me 青春如同奔流的江河 Youth like a swift current
                               Rushing by without saying good-bye
                               Leaving me behind, numb cold spent
                                    A beautiful flower faded
                                  At its prime time in spring
                          But who cares if it ever lived in this world
                                 Turn over the past years world
                      Witnessing unions and departures, joy s and sorrows
                            The wondering boy envies the wild goose
                    That flies to his home in the south before winter comes
                        People go in different directions, away and gone
                   But where is my future, just simple, ordinary days for me
                                 Oh, who can give me the answer
                       Where are you, the girl who used to sit by my side
                  Are you still beautiful and lovely, as the girl in my memory
                                 Have you realized your dreams
                               Maybe we'll let bygones be bygones
                       However hard I may try, I cannot find my true self
            A million stars are twinkling in the sky, and I try to find out the one
                   That used to stay by me, oh my dear companion of yesterday
                       Do you still remember the time we shared together
                       Life, like a sculptor's graver, cold and ruthless
                                     has changed our shape
                  Will the flower wither before it ever has a chance to bloom
                                  But I used to have my dream
                                   Youth like a swift current
                               rushing by without saying goodbye
                              Leaving me behind, numb, cold, spent
                                    A beautiful flower faded
                                  At its prime time in spring
                          But who cares if it ever lived in this world
                                 Have you realized your dreams
                               Maybe we'll let bygones be bygones
                       However hard I may try, I cannot find my true self
            A million stars are twinkling in the sky, and I try to find out the one
                   That used to stay by me, oh my dear companion of yesterday
                        Do you still remember the happening here before
             If tomorrow ever comes, I'll send my best wishes to you, my dear girl
