I toke this vedio about May 3rd (according to the video file info), at mclean
church.

[the refered text in the
vedio](http://www.enduringword.com/commentaries/2344.htm) are:

“Without the Spirit of God we can do nothing; we are as ships without wind, or
chariots without steeds, like branches without sap, we are withered; like coals
without fire, we are useless; as an offering without the sacrificial flame, we
are unaccepted. I desire both to feel and to confess this fact whenever I
attempt to preach. I do not wish to get away from it, or to conceal it, nor can
I, for I am often made to feel it to the deep humbling of my spirit.”

Just a comment from a stupid worldly guy , who is , in theory, willing to pursue
a 'non-fake belief' in the darkness of this faithless world, but would rather have
'no faith' instead of 'faithlessly have a faith' or 'faithfully believe in a fake
faith', according to his currently mindset/understanding:

the more you believe in this, the luckier you ARE (I didn't say "WILL BE").
seriously -- I hope I can become lucky too.
