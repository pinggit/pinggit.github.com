## 旧约-- 创世记(Genesis) -- 第42 章( 本篇共有50 章)    　


42:1    雅各见埃及有粮，就对儿子们说，你们为什么彼此观望呢。
Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?

42:2    我听见埃及有粮，你们可以下去，从那里为我们籴些来，使我们可以存活，不至于死。
And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.

42:3    于是，约瑟的十个哥哥都下埃及籴粮去了。
And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

42:4    但约瑟的兄弟便雅悯，雅各没有打发他和哥哥们同去，因为雅各说，恐怕他遭害。
But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.

42:5    来籴粮的人中有以色列的儿子们，因为迦南地也有饥荒。
And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

42:6    当时治理埃及地的是约瑟。粜粮给那地众民的就是他。约瑟的哥哥们来了，脸伏于地，向他下拜。
And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.

42:7    约瑟看见他哥哥们，就认得他们，却装作生人，向他们说些严厉话，问他们说，你们从哪里来。他们说，我们从迦南地来籴粮。
And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.

42:8    约瑟认得他哥哥们，他们却不认得他。
And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.



42:9    约瑟想起从前所作的那两个梦，就对他们说，你们是奸细，来窥探这地的虚实。
And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.

42:10    他们对他说，我主阿，不是的。仆人们是籴粮来的。
And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.

42:11    我们都是一个人的儿子，是诚实人。仆人们并不是奸细。
We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.

42:12    约瑟说，不然，你们必是窥探这地的虚实来的。
And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.

42:13    他们说，仆人们本是弟兄十二人，是迦南地一个人的儿子，顶小的现今在我们的父亲那里，有一个没有了。
And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.

42:14    约瑟说，我才说你们是奸细，这话实在不错。
And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:

42:15    我指着法老的性命起誓，若是你们的小兄弟不到这里来，你们就不得出这地方，从此就可以把你们证验出来了。
Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

42:16    须要打发你们中间一个人去，把你们的兄弟带来。至于你们，都要囚在这里，好证验你们的话涉不真，若不真，我指着法老的性命起誓，你们一定是奸细。
Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.

42:17    于是约瑟把他们都下在监里三天。
And he put them all together into ward three days.

42:18    到了第三天，约瑟对他们说，我是敬畏神的。你们照我的话行就可以存活。
And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:

42:19    你们如果是诚实人，可以留你们中间的一个人囚在监里，但你们可以带着粮食回去，救你们家里的饥荒。
If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:

42:20    把你们的小兄弟带到我这里来，如此，你们的话便有证据，你们也不至于死。他们就照样而行。
But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

42:21    他们彼此说，我们在兄弟身上实在有罪。他哀求我们的时候，我们见他心里的愁苦，却不肯听，所以这场苦难临到我们身上。
And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.

42:22    流便说，我岂不是对你们说过，不可伤害那孩子吗。只是你们不肯听，所以流他血的罪向我们追讨。
And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.

42:23    他们不知道约瑟听得出来，因为在他们中间用通事传话。
And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.

42:24    约瑟转身退去，哭了一场，又回来对他们说话，就从他们中间挑出西缅来，在他们眼前把他捆绑。
And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.

42:25    约瑟吩咐人把粮食装满他们的器具，把各人的银子归还在各人的口袋里，又给他们路上用的食物，人就照他的话办了。
Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.

42:26    他们就把粮食驮在驴上，离开那里去了。
And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.

42:27    到了住宿的地方，他们中间有一个人打开口袋，要拿料喂驴，才看见自己的银子仍在口袋里，
And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.

42:28    就对弟兄们说，我的银子归还了，看阿，仍在我口袋里。他们就提心吊胆，战战兢兢地彼此说，这是神向我们作什么呢，
And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?

42:29    他们来到迦南地，他们的父亲雅各那里，将所遭遇的事都告诉他，说，
And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,

42:30    那地的主对我们说严厉的话，把我们当作窥探那地的奸细。
The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.

42:31    我们对他说，我们是诚实人，并不是奸细。
And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:

42:32    我们本是弟兄十二人，都是一个父亲的儿子，有一个没有了，顶小的如今同我们的父亲在迦南地。
We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

42:33    那地的主对我们说，若要我知道你们是诚实人，可以留下你们中间的一个人在我这里，你们可以带着粮食回去，救你们家里的饥荒。
And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:

42:34    把你们的小兄弟带到我这里来，我便知道你们不是奸细，乃是诚实人。这样，我就把你们的弟兄交给你们，你们也可以在这地作买卖。
And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.

42:35    后来他们倒口袋，不料，各人的银包都在口袋里。他们和父亲看见银包就都害怕。
And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.

42:36    他们的父亲雅各对他们说，你们使我丧失我的儿子，约瑟没有了，西缅也没有了，你们又要将便雅悯带去。这些事都归到我身上了。
And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.

42:37    流便对他父亲说，我若不带他回来交给你，你可以杀我的两个儿子。只管把他交在我手里，我必带他回来交给你。
And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.

42:38    雅各说，我的儿子不可与你们一同下去。他哥哥死了，只剩下他，他若在你们所行的路上遭害，那便是你们使我白发苍苍，悲悲惨惨地下阴间去了。
And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
