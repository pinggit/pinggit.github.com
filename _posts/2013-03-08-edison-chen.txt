Today I have come back to Hong Kong to stand before you `and account for
myself.  [对…负有责任；对…做出解释；说明……的原因] I've never escaped from my
responsibility. During the past few weeks, I've been with my mother `and my
family and my loved ones `to show support and care `and at the same time `(to)
have them support and care for me.

I admit that most of the photos being circulated [传播]on the Internet `were
taken by me. But these photos are very private `and have not been shown to
people `and are never intended to be shown to anyone. These photos were stolen
from me illegally `and distributed without my consent. [kən'sent] There is no
doubt whoever obtained these photos `have them uploaded on the Internet with
malicious and deliberate intent. [di'libərət] adj. 故意的；深思熟虑的；从容的
This matter has deteriorated to the extent that society as a whole has been
affected by this. [di'tiəriəreit] 恶化 And in this regard, I am deeply saddened.
['sædn] v. (使)黯淡,  (使)悲伤 I would like now to apologize `to all the people
for all the suffering that has been caused and the problems that have arisen [ə
    'rizən] from this. 

I would like to apologize to all the ladies `and to all their families `for any
harm or hurt that they have been feeling.  I am sorry. I would like to also
apologize to my mother and my father `for the pain and suffering that I have
caused them `during the past few weeks.  Most importantly, I would like to say
sorry to all the people of Hong Kong. I give my apology sincerely to you all,
unreservedly [,ʌnri'zə:vidli] adv. 无限制地, 不客气地, 率直地 and with my
heart.
														    
I know young people in Hong Kong look up to many figures in our society. And in
this regard, I have failed. I failed as a role model 榜样. However, I wish this
matter will teach everyone a lesson. To all the young people in our community,
let this be a lesson for you all. This is not an example to be set for you.

During my time away, I've made an important decision. I will whole-heartedly
`fulfill all commitments that I have to date [到目前为止]. But after that, I
decided to step away from the Hong Kong entertainment industry. I've decided
to do this to give myself an opportunity `to heal myself and to search my soul.
I will dedicate my time `to charity and community work `within the next few
months. I will be away from Hong Kong entertainment indefinitely.
There is no time frame.

I've been assisting the police `since the first day the photos were published
`and I will continue to assist them. After this press con., I have obligations
to help them with their investigation `and hope that this case can end soon `as
everyone I think has the same wish.[press conference 新闻发布会]

I would like to use this opportunity `to thank the police for their hard work on
this case. Thank you. I believe everyone’s priority now (and) my priority now`
is to stop the suffering and pain, for not letting this…we do not want to let
this situation become more out of control. We need to protect all the innocent
`and all the young `from matters like this. In this regard, I'veinstructed my
lawyers to do everything possible within the law `to protect all the innocent
victims of this case. I believe that a press statement is being issued as we
speak on what my lawyers have advised me to do. (新闻公报)

Lastly, I would like to thank everyone for coming here today `and listening to
what I have to say. I would like to also `apologize `once again to all the ladies
and their families, my family `and to everyone in Hong Kong `and everyone in our
society. I am deeply saddened by this. And I apologize that everyone (who) has to
go through this. I would like to also thank you `for giving me this opportunity
`to say `what I have wanted to say all along in my heart.[始终;一直]

I hope after today, I can have your forgiveness. With regard to this case,
with everything, everything that has happened, I am deeply sorry. I hope you
all will accept my apology and give me a chance. Thank you.

我回到香港，一个人面对这一切，我从来没有想过逃避，这几周我一直和我的妈妈，我的
家人在一起，他们一直支持和帮助我。

　　我承认这次事件中的大多数照片都是我拍的，但是它们都是在很隐私的情况下拍摄的
，而且我从来没有想过向别人展示，毫无疑问，是有人非法从我这里窃取了这些照片，没
有经过我的同意，并在互联网上恶意传播，给这个社会造成了恶劣的影响，我非常遗憾。

　　我要向所有为此次事件受到伤害的人表达歉意，向相关的女士和她们的家人受到的伤
害道歉，向我的家人道歉，我的父母道歉，最重要的是，我要向全香港的人民道歉，我衷
心地毫无保留地表达我的歉意。

　　我知道这个时代的年轻人崇拜这个社会的偶像，但我不是榜样，我希望这次的事件可
以教育年轻人，我做出的事情并不是榜样应该做的事情。

　　我决定，我将在全心全意履行完已经承诺的工作之后，退出香港娱乐圈，医治自己的
伤口和灵魂，我还会贡献时间做慈善，然后我将永远的离开娱乐圈。

　　我希望这件事能尽快结束，从照片流出的第一天开始，我就一直在配合警方，我感谢
警方做出的辛勤工作。现在的当务之急是停止伤害，不要让这件事陷入进一步失控的境地
，以保护无辜的人和年轻人。我要求我的律师在法律允许的范围内帮助那些受害者。

　　最后，我要谢谢你们可以到这里听我的解释，谢谢你们给我机会听我的解释，我希望
你们可以原谅我，以及这件事带来的伤害，我要再次向被牵扯到这次事件中的女士道歉，
向她们的亲属道歉，向我的家人道歉，向全香港的人民道歉，希望将来你们可以再给我一
次机会。
