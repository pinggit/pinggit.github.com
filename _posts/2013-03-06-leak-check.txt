Did You Have a High Water and _Sewer_ Bill?       ['su:ә] n. 下水

Your water may have been running,
*unintentionally*, for more than 24 hours!

When our meter reading trucks are in the
service area *pulling* meter readings, our      pull是个黄金词
system will sometimes notice homes that have
had water running for long periods of time.
Our meter reading system will notify the
service representative of a potential leak if
water has been _flowing through_ the water
meter for over 24 hours. If our meter reading
trucks receive notification of a possible
leak, we will notify those customers through
a note on their water and *wastewater* bill or
by leaving a hanging door tag.

If you have not received notification on your
bill or a hanging doortag, but still believe
your bill is too high, please use the
following checklist for water usage both
inside and outside the home:

=== Inside your Home

ifdef::basebackend-html[[subs="quotes"]]
ifdef::basebackend-html[....]

Put your hand on the side of the _toilet tank_
If the tank is cold and _sweating_ and the     [swet] 出汗, 渗出, 烦恼
toilet has not been flushed for a while, you
may have a leak.  Remove the _tank lid_ and
_squeeze_ a few drops of food coloring into the 紧握, 挤, 榨取
_back tank_. Wait 10 minutes; if color shows up
in the bowl the _flapper_ is leaking and needs  阻水阀,挡板
to be replaced. You can purchase flapper kits
at local hardware stores or call a
professional to replace the flapper. If you
do not have food coloring, contact us for
*toilet dye tablets*.                           n. 颜料, 染料

Check the water level in the tank by taking
off the cover.  The level should be set so it
is below the overflow level.  If you have to
_*jiggle* the flush handle_ on your toilet to get (使)轻摇, (使)微动
it to stop running, the _flush level bar_ and
chain (or the handle itself) may be _sticking_.
There are some flapper kits that also contain
replacement flush handles and chains.

Look for wet, *warped* or *discolored* stains on 美[wɔrp] 变形, 弯曲,
your ceilings, floors, walls and _woodwork_     变色,木制品, 木制家具
(such as bottom of your kitchen and bathroom
_sink cabinets_).                               柜式洗涤槽

Be sure that the pressure release valve line    活瓣, 阀, 活门
on your water heater is not dripping.  This     滴, 滴下物, 水滴
would be the line that is *perpendicular* with    [,pә:pәn'dikjulә] n. 垂直线
the water heater and dumps water into a pan
or _floor drain_.                               地漏；[建] 地面排水管

Be sure that your *humidifier* is set correctly
to prevent over usage of water.  Check the
manufacturing _directions_ to see if you can
adjust it, or a heating or cooling company may
need to _make adjustments_

=== Outside Your Home

ifdef::basebackend-html[[subs="quotes"]]
ifdef::basebackend-html[....]

Walk around your home and check your yard to
see if there are any *saturated* spots or very  ['sætʃәreitid] 饱和的, 渗透的
green spots in your yard. These spots may
mean a leak in the _irrigation line_ or a leak
from the meter to the house. Or the above
ground sprinkler is watering an area for too
long and may need a timing adjustment.

Check your sprinkler system for broken heads
or broken pipes.  Check your outside *hose bibs*  软管龙头 
to see if they are dripping. If so the
valve may not be holding.                       活瓣, 阀, 活门

We can help you determine whether or not you
have a leak, and we may be able to help you
locate the leak, by scheduling a leak check
appointment. To schedule a leak check
appointment, please call Customer Service at
571.291.7880.
