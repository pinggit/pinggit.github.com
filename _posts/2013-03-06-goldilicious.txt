=== part I
I was putting flowers on the *mane* of my pet *unicorn*. +
"Pinkalicious,why are you dropping flowers on the *rug*?" asked Mommy +
"I'm not dropping flowers. I am *getting Goldie ready* for the Unicorn *Ball*," I
said, *prancing around* the room. +
"What unicorn? I don't see any unicorn," said Peter. +
"She's right here and she's not ANY unicorn, she is my unicorn. Her name is
Goldilicious, Goldie *for short*. Oh, Goldie-- you shouldn't have done that on
the floor! *You know better*, just *neigh* when you need to *go to the potty*.
I'm sorry, Peter, but you are *stepping right in* it," I said. +

"Mommy! What is Pinkalicious talking about?" *whined* Peter. +
"Pinkalicious, It's okay to have an *imaginary* friend, but maybe it's time to
put Goldie back in her *stall* or take her outside the house, where she can 
*run free*."
