== Why Daylight Saving Time Should Be Abolished

It’s that time of year in the U.S. when clocks “fall back” from Daylight Saving
Time to standard time. What does that mean? Well, you get back the hour of sleep
you lost last spring and you can look forward to a week or so of feeling
discombobulated.

The railroads were the first to set the time in the 19th century, coordinating
distant clocks so that trains could run on theoretically precise timetables
(this cut down on crashes.). You can also thank railroads for time zones—
geographic swaths of the globe set to the same hour.

But it was evening-time activists like entomologist George Vernon Hudson and
golfer William Willett who can be blamed for Daylight Saving Time. Noting that a
little extra well-lit time on a balmy evening would be nicer than in the morning
when everybody’s asleep anyway, the two independently proposed shifting clocks
forward for the spring and summer. Governments soon seized upon the idea as a
way to cut down on energy use — more sunlight in the evening means less
coal-burned to provide artificial alternatives.

Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to hold up too well. And changing back and
forth to Daylight Saving Time twice a year seems to be bad for human health —
from increased risk of heart attack to more mine accidents. Nevertheless, in
2007, the U.S. Congress saw fit to extend Daylight Saving Time‘s reign from
earlier in spring to deeper into fall in 2007.

It would make more sense to either scrap Daylight Saving Time or turn it into
standard time—in effect, make it permanent. But since when have we been sensible
about time management?
