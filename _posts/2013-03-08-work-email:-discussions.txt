    TAC, Folks – rcvd call from Kevin/FNOC that EDGE router (slot 		TAC,各位： 收到FNOC kevin的电话称EDGE路由器（15槽）
    15) stopped passing traffic [10 days ago]… I believe this is one of those 	停止转发流量（十天前）。。我觉得这是那些"假报错"
    cosmetic error one (HF2200) – but Kevin mentioned that he looked at the 	之一（修复编号2200) － 但kevin说他查看了路由器

    also opening the TAC case also… Thanks, /Tom.

==== From: Tom

    Sam, Not sure if you already spoke with Kevin/FNOC?  FYI – Kev called me 	sam,你跟FNOC的kevin聊过么？下面的供你参考－kevin打给我
    and I asked how did they find the issue (if it’s down for 10 days…) – Kev 	了，我问他怎么发现的问题（既然10天前就down了。。）－
    mentioned that they had some outage earlier (external to EDGE)  that 	kevin提到他们之前发现了一些（EDGE路由器外部的）故障影响
    knocked bunch of GE circuits, so while Kev was working with transport team 	了一批GE电路，当他跟传输团队查问题的时候发现15槽没有流量
    he noticed NO traffic on slot 15. (but again looks like the traffic went 	（但再次重申，貌似15槽流量停止是远在VZ今天报告问题之前。。
    down on s15 way before the outage VZ reported today… something to check if 	得查查是不是有些链路现在down了。
    some links are down now.) /Tom. 						（try:FYI是For Your Info-供你信息参考。VZ是客户公司名）

==== From: Sam

    As I mentioned below, the BGP to the VAR went down about 4 hrs ago... 	如我之前说的，VAR上的BGP是4小时前刚down的。。我想John
    I think John tried to call to Kevin as he owns the case, but not sure if 	已尝试过给kevin打电话，因为case是他的。不清楚拿到什么信息
    he had anything back from him yet...Thanks!                                 没有。。（try:VAR是某对端设备的所写，具体不重要）

==== From: John

    Hi Folks, I've asked VZ to look into external issue(s), since a LAG was 	大家好。我已让VZ去查看外部问题了，因为LAG down了但所有member

==== From: John
    So the consensus[kәn'sensәs] is that this is an external issue, right?  	那么目前的共识就是外部故障喽？
    [Sendil] Yes .  								[Sendil]没错。
    Is there any reason I should not allow the customer to failover now?	有什么不让用户现在切换的理由么？
    [Sendil] We do not have any reason to deny this. However, 			[Sendil]那倒没有。但是切换也许不会解决问题，因为MAC接口

==== From: Tilak
    Hi, As suspected earlier this is a link issue.  We pulled out the member 	如我们之前怀疑的，这是个链路问题。我们把LAG中的memeber
    interface from the LAG bundle one by one on each side (EDGE & CISCO) and 	链路在两端（EDGE和CISCO ）逐个拔出做ping测试。
    did a ping test.  Out of 4 member interfaces on the LAG bundle, only 15/1/0 结果LAG中4个member接口中，只有15/1/0(连接到CISCO的8/32)
    (connected to gig 8/32 on CISCO) has end to end connectivity. Currently LAG 端到端是好的。目前LAG上只有15/1/0,是好的并且转发流量。

=== Part III

==== From: John

    Is 15/0/1 up?  Maybe it is miss-connected too.

==== From: Tilak J R

    Hi, On EDGE all the member interfaces are up (as observed before during the
    problem).  During problematic situation, @ the CISCO all the interfaces
    including the port-channel stayed down, may be the no LACP communication
    happening.  In lab observed that on aggregated link between CISCO and EDGE,
    when on one of the member interfaces on EDGE, LACP is disabled, all the
    interfaces on the CISCO including the port-channel go down. No traffic
    passes over the LAG bundle although the member interfaces @ EDGE show up.
    May be the above behavior could because of this?  Logs collected during the
    problematic situation attached.  Just want to bring to your attention, all
    the steps carried out with the help of VZNOC, TAC didn’t have
    direct access to the router, there is some ongoing issue @ the VZ end.

==== From: Dinesh S

    Hi, From the Logs, I am able to see the LAG bundle went down due to all the
    LAG members are not in online.  Here Member -0, 1, & 3 are in waiting state
    due to corresponding Partner  Lag members went down or removed from the LAG
    bundle  or lacp is disabled or the minimum link configured is not met.  And
    the member -2 is in Detached state due to interface shutdown or no physical
    connection.

    What will be the minimum link configured on the Lag bundle?

    Can I get the LAG configuration on Slot-15?  
    _____________________________________________

==== From: John

    Scott, Should we add 1 more command (ethDumpInterfaces) to the script?
    Dinesh, It might make more sense to work with Tilak on this, since he did
    most of the work.  I do not have access to the routers now.  LACP might
    have been the issue--it was already confirmed that the physical connection
    was wrong.  The intfs were physically up.  I do not know what you mean by
    "min link".  min time config'd between LACP rx'd msgs?  actual min time
    between LACP rx'd msgs?  on our side or cisco side?  min intf id #?
    Thanks, -John

==== From: Dinesh S

    Hi John, I meant to say that, We have the option to configure the LAG
    bundle with minimum no. of links.  (For eg.,  the minimum no. of link
    configured on the LAG bundle is 3, then at least  3 member links should be
    in online, else LAG will go down. This is applicable  for both end.  FYI )
    Thanks & Regards,

==== From: John

    OK, the new feature.  Got it.  I don't think VZ uses that feature.
    Tom/Sam, do you know?  Again, we currently don't have access to this
    router and in this case I did not grab the config when I did have access.
    Would it be indicated here (IMHO, it should be)?:  (try: IMHO-In My Humble
    Opinion) CMDNNJ-VFTTP-37:vol#sh int LAG members

==== From: Dinesh S

    Hi Tilak, In Logs, I am able to see all the Interfaces on the  CISCO  router
    is down.  LACP communication is not happened(try:should be happening?).   So
    that LAG bundle on EDGE went down.	As you said, Physical  interface  states
    for the LAG member	interfaces  @  our  end  was  up.   Can  you  make  sure
    interfaces	of  CISCO  router  are	physically  connected  to  interfaces(in
    slot-15) on our EDGE router?.  Do you have	the  logs  for	“show  interface
    gigbitEthernet  15/1/0,  15/1/4,  15/0/0/15/0/4”  from  our   EDGE	 router.
    If all interfaces are up in EDGE router,  then  we	need  to  check  whether
    all Interfaces are connected  with	specified  CISCO  router  or  somewhere.
    I suspecting this  issue  is  related  to  Interface  not  related	to  LAG.
    Thanks & Regards,
