when I was 27 years old I left a very demanding job in management consulting
for a job that was even more demanding - teaching. I went to teach
seventh-graders math in the New York City public schools and like any teacher I
made quizzes and tests. I gave out homework assignments. When the work came
back, I calculated grades. What struck me was that IQ was not the only
difference between my best and my worst students. Some of my strongest
performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores. Some of my smartest kids
weren't doing so well. And that got me thinking. The kinds of things you need
to learn in seventh grade math, sure they're hard - ratios, decimals, the area
of a parallelogram, but these concepts are not impossible. And I was firmly
convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked
hard and long enough. After several more years of teaching, I came to the
conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of
students and learning from a motivational perspective - from a psychological
perspective. In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ, but
what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability
to learn quickly and easily. 

I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super-challenging settings.
And in every study my question was - who is successful here and why? My
research team and I went to West Point Military Academy. We tried to predict
which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out. We
studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods, asking, which
teachers are still going to be here, in teaching, by the end of the school
year? And of those, who will be the most effective at improving learning
outcomes for their students? We partnered with private companies asking, which
of these salespeople's going to keep their jobs? And who's going to earn the
most money? In all those very different contexts, one characteristic emerged as
a significant predictor of success and it wasn't social intelligence, it wasn't
good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ. It was grit.

Grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals ; Grit is having
stamina; Grit is sticking with your future , day in day out , not just for the
week , not just for the month , but for years and working really really hard to
make that future reality 

Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint. A few years ago, I
started studying grit in the Chicago public schools. I asked thousands of high
school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited around more than a
year to see who would graduate.

Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate even
when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure. Things like family
income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt when they
were at school.

so it's not just at west point for the National Spelling Bee that print matters
its also in school especially for kids at risk for dropping out to me the most
shocking thing about Brit is how little we know how little science knows about
building it 

Everyday, parents and teachers ask me, how do I build grit in kids? What do I
do to teach kids a solid work ethic? How do I keep them motivated for the long
run? The honest answer is, I don't know. So far, the best idea I've heard about
building grit in kids is something called growth mindset. This is an idea
developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the
ability to learn is not fixed. That it can change with your effort. Dr. Dweck
has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and
grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persevere when they
fail because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.

so brought mine said is a great idea for building for it but we need more and
that's where I'm gonna and my remarks because that's where we are that's the
work that stands before us we need to take our best ideas our strongest
intuitions and we need to test them we need to measure whether we've been
successful and we have to be willing to fail to be wrong to start over again
with lessons learnt in other words we need to be gritty about getting our kids
readier thank you
