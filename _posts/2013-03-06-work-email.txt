Hi Scott, In the lab setup reproduce the issue *freshly* and collect the 		['setʌp]重音在前
following logs in the system.  Activate the HF only after the reproduction of 		['æktiveit]大嘴
the issue. So that we can avoid unnecessary logs. 					[ʌn'nesәsәri; -seri]更似第二种,第二个元音要明确发出,不可掠过
1.   During the test:  										 ^ 	^
wireshark log – to see the communication between (dhcp client) Ixia and router.  	['waiә]shark大嘴[bi'twi:n] -> [bi'tuwi:n]
2.   After the test – Once the problem is reproduced:
show ip tcp statistics . 								[stә'tistiks]第一"ti"清晰发出,第二"ti"作di
Activate the fix 46001 and enable the below flag in shell: 				     ^	^ shell[ʃel] vs. share
-> staleHttpcEntryCheck = 1 								stale

Now the situation is all incoming http packet will be rejected as “ Too many 		[ɔ:l]->实际似毫无儿化,对比"or"
connection” ; Send some few http packets from Ixia  ,Then for each “Too many
connection” rejection action, This hotfix will print the existing entries
present in the HttpcTable.  So don’t send too many packets to router after this 	['teibl]重音,not['teibɔ],更似['teibәʋ]; enable同样

Hi Scott, Thanks for providing the test setup with flexibility of dev engineers
requirement. Which helps me to narrow down the issue in fast track mode.  I
have tested with fix in your setup. It seems the fix is working fine. Please
verify the fix from your side and share me the result.  The fix is already in
active state in your setup 10.3.200.3.  Without fix, whenever I enabled the
httpServer and policy config ; the problem is reproduced in few minutes.  With
HF the problem is not seen 5-6 hours, still it’s going.

Hi Sam, There was a mistake done in the previous mail chain; I have *clubbed* the
Ping test issue here with the influence of some other cases.  Actually it’s not
available in your shared logs.
 
==== From: Sam
Hi Raja, Thanks for all your *input*...+As of now+, it is most likely some time 	as of now...至于现在。。input:意见，看法，所有对问题"输入"的东西
tomorrow our time we will have a chance to look at the issue on a different
router [washington dc-vfttp-131].
 
==== From: Scott

Raja, I believe that I’ve been able to reproduce the customer problem here in 		
the lab. The router is 10.3.200.3. The subscriber is a DHCP user *off* this 		off的用法 ，相当于 from
interface: I get the same log message that we saw at customer site: The server
is +tearing down+ the initial TCP connection attempt from the client: I haven’t         tearing,['tєәriŋ] not [tiәriŋ]，常用词，拆连接
tried to reproduce it more than once, so I’m not sure how easy it is to get. I          a bunch of stuff很多（其^ 他）东西 
tried +a bunch of stuff+ today, but I think I hit it by just *hammering* the box 	hammper,地道用法，用锤子砸，意思是折腾设备使得bug重现
with a single user having multiple *concurrent* TCP connections. Feel free to 		['mʌltipl] like ['mɔltipl]
collect whatever data you want *off* my system. Once you have what you need, I 				   ^
can clear the condition and see how repeatable the condition is. If you have
problems with access, TAC in BNG or US should be able to +get you in+ or get you        ['ækses] NOT [әk'ses] get .. in :把。。。弄进去
the data you need. 									speed:normal 4b/57s max

Thanks! Scott; hopefully router (in +broken-state+) should help Development…
Raja, Please let us know if you need any additional info… I know we are still
working on root-cause… it will be helpful if (as soon) we can get some 			root-cause: 根本原因。[ru:t]发音简单，但微妙得很 [kɔ:z]not[kɔ:ls],也没有儿化
*indication* that this is hotfixable? [and not to get too far ahead :) – this 		[,indi'keiʃәn]                                       ^      ^^^^
will probably be another RP hotfix; we need to make sure if we can *deploy* this
on routers (already running 12.1.1) without needing reload; for example, post 		[iɡ'zæmpl] 重音夸张
activation, disable/enable http-server +will do the trick?+]
 
==== From: Raja
 
We have discussed in the separate mail chain and suspect some of the area – 		['eәriә] 圆滑的感觉
like the same host limit enforcement and age out on each client connection.  I 		[in'fɔ:smәnt]->美语有儿化 host [hәust] o, not [hɔst]
will provide the debug HotFix to scott team by *EOD*. I will share the HotFix 		EndOfDay:常用缩写
details once I have created a debug HotFix..    					[kri:'eit] 重音一定要单独发出
 
==== From: Raja

Hi Scott, In the lab setup reproduce the issue *freshly* and collect the 		['setʌp]重音在前
following logs in the system.  Activate the HF only after the reproduction of 		['æktiveit]大嘴
the issue. So that we can avoid unnecessary logs. 					[ʌn'nesәsәri; -seri]更似第二种,第二个元音要明确发出,不可掠过
1.   During the test:  										 ^ 	^
wireshark log – to see the communication between (dhcp client) Ixia and router.  	['waiә]shark大嘴[bi'twi:n] -> [bi'tuwi:n]
2.   After the test – Once the problem is reproduced:
show ip tcp statistics . 								[stә'tistiks]第一"ti"清晰发出,第二"ti"作di
Activate the fix 46001 and enable the below flag in shell: 				     ^	^ shell[ʃel] vs. share
-> staleHttpcEntryCheck = 1 								stale

Now the situation is all incoming http packet will be rejected as “ Too many 		[ɔ:l]->实际似毫无儿化,对比"or"
connection” ; Send some few http packets from Ixia  ,Then for each “Too many
connection” rejection action, This hotfix will print the existing entries
present in the HttpcTable.  So don’t send too many packets to router after this 	['teibl]重音,not['teibɔ],更似['teibәʋ]; enable同样
flag is enabled. 									   ^^ ^  	      ^
3.   Do core dump on RP and share the core dump. 					share[ʃєә] vs. shell

==== From: Scott

Raja, I replicated the problem again and collected as much of the requested 			   v 			vv 		       v vv
data as I could.  The CLI, log data, and core dump are posted.  Unfortunately,  	[ʌn'fɔ:tjʋnәtli] not [ʌn'fɔ:tjʋneitli], like [ʌn'fɔ:chnә-li],'t'音极轻
the system +can’t keep up with+ the volume of log data with httpServer and 		赶不上，来不及处理
tcpEngineering enabled, so you’ll find that there are a high number of dropped
messages: I also have 2 capture files in that same location.  The larger file 		[fail] like [faiɔ]not fire ['faiә]
was taken when the problem was being replicated.  The smaller file is taken
after the router is already in the +broken condition+.  If you need more data or 	or :youdao[ɔ:, ə],jinshan[ɔ:(r)],极强儿化感,对比all
tests, please let me know.  Thanks,
 
==== From: Raja

Hi Scott, In the shared logs we could see the TCP connections are available in
the system even after done with client.  Unfortunately so many logs dropped we
are not able to *conclude* on the issue.  Please share the setup with Ixia keep
running with http send. So that we will further analyze and share the update by
Monday.  

=== part III

==== From: Raja V 

Hi Scott, Thanks for providing the test setup with flexibility of dev engineers
requirement. Which helps me to narrow down the issue in fast track mode.  I
have tested with fix in your setup. It seems the fix is working fine. Please
verify the fix from your side and share me the result.  The fix is already in
active state in your setup 10.3.200.3.  Without fix, whenever I enabled the
httpServer and policy config ; the problem is reproduced in few minutes.  With
HF the problem is not seen 5-6 hours, still it’s going.
 
==== From: Ikram Ali 

Raja (Scott), Thx for the update… looks like the FIX is looking/running good.
[I had a sidebar with Scott – he concur]. Scott will do further testing to make 	[kәn'kә:(r)]'
sure everything is good.  So, once we get the +green light+, please let us know
(ETA time) when we will be able to check this in and ready for VZ delivery?  Thanks,
 
==== From: Raja V

Here I have attached the problem summary  for the future reference, Once I get
confirmation from Scott; I will start the process of providing the fix from dev
side on the same day.
