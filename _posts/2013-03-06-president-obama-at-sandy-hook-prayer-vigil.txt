Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Governor.	['klә:dʒi]
To all the families, first responders, to the   n. 牧师, 僧侣, 神职人员
community of Newtown, *clergy*, guests —	['skriptʃә]
*Scripture* tells us: *"...do not lose heart.*	n. 圣经, 圣经的一节
*Though _outwardly_ we are _wasting away_*      表面上, 在外, 外表上
*... _inwardly_ we are being renewed day by*	浪费（青春，时间。。）

*_outweighs_ them all. So we fix our eyes not on* 比...重, 
*what is seen, but on what is unseen, since*      比...有价值
*what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen* [,ʌn'sin]
*is eternal. For we know that if the earthly*
*tent we live in is destroyed, we have a*
*building from God, an eternal house in*
*heaven, not built by human hands."*

We gather here _in memory of_ twenty beautiful
children and six remarkable adults. They lost
their lives in a school that _could have been_ 记得课本里说的"虚拟语气"？
any school; in a quiet town full of good and
decent people that _could be_ any town in
America.

Here in Newtown, I come to offer the love and	[prєә, 'preiә]
*prayers* of a nation. I am very *mindful* that 祈祷, 祷辞, 祈祷者
_mere_ words cannot match the depths of your   ['maidful]
*sorrow*, nor can they heal your _wounded_	 a. 深切注意的, 
hearts. I can only hope it helps for you to     留神的, 留心的
know that you're not alone in your *grief*;    [wi:p]
that our world too has been *torn apart*; that	 n. 哭, 哭泣
all across this land of ours, we have *wept*    vi. 哭泣, 流泪, 
with you, we've pulled our children tight.      哀悼, 滴落
And you must know that _whatever measure_ of     
comfort we can provide, we will provide;
whatever portion of sadness that we can share
with you to *ease this heavy load,* we will	【常用词】
gladly _bear_ it.  Newtown — you are not alone.

As these difficult days have *unfolded*, you've
also inspired us with stories of strength and
*resolve* and sacrifice. We know that when	决定之事, 决心, 坚决
danger arrived in the halls of Sandy Hook
Elementary, the school's staff did not		[flintʃ]
*flinch*, they did not hesitate. Dawn           vi. 畏缩, 退缩, 畏首畏尾
Hochsprung and Mary Sherlach, Vicki Soto,       n. 退缩, 弗林奇戏
Lauren Rousseau, Rachel Davino and Anne Marie
Murphy — they responded as we all hope we
_might respond_ in such _terrifying circumstances_ 
— with courage and with love,
giving their lives to protect the children in
their care.

We know that there were other teachers who	[,bæri'keid]
*barricaded* themselves inside classrooms, and  设路障于, 阻碍
_kept steady_ through it all, and *reassured*     使...安心, 向...再保证
their students by saying "wait for the good	keep steady
guys, they're coming"; "show me your smile."	保持事态平稳发展

And we know that good guys came. The first	at bay(猎物等) 被困
responders who *raced* to the scene, helping to   比速度,全速行进
guide _those in harm's_ way to safety, and	处于走投无路的境地
comfort _those in need_, *holding at bay* their  ['trɒ:mә]
own shock and *trauma* because they had a job   n. 外伤, 损伤
to do, and others needed them more.		【医】 创伤, 外伤
					     
And then there were the scenes of the           
schoolchildren, helping one another, holding
each other, *dutifully* following instructions	悲痛的演讲，还能穿插玩笑？
in the way that young children sometimes do;	(try:Laughter.)
one child even trying to encourage a *grown-up* 成年人
by saying, "I know *karate*. So it's okay. I'll [kә'rɑ:ti]
_lead the way out_."				n. 空手道

As a community, you've inspired us, Newtown.	[,indi'skraibәbl]
_In the face of_ *indescribable* violence, in the 不能用语言表达的, 
face of *unconscionable* evil, you've looked    不可名状的, 莫名其妙的
out for each other, and you've cared for one	[,ʌn'kɒnʃәnәbl]
another, and you've loved one another.  This    a. 不受良心支配的, 
is how Newtown will be remembered. And with     不合理的, 过度的
time, and God's grace, that love will _see you_ 有道：看穿
_through_.

But we, as a nation, we are left with some
hard questions. Someone once described the
joy and *anxiety* of *parenthood* as the 	[æŋ'zaɪəti] `ŋ` 要发出
_equivalent of_ having your heart outside of	['preʃәs] 等价`物`(not ..ence)
your body all the time, walking around. With    a. 宝贵的, 珍贵的, 
their very first cry, this most *precious*,     过于精致的, 珍爱的
vital part of ourselves — our child — is
suddenly exposed to the world, to possible	['mis,hæp]
*mishap* or *malice*. And every parent knows    n. 不幸之事, 灾祸, 恶运
there is nothing we will not do to *shield* our ['mælis]
children from harm. And yet, *we also know*     恶意, 蓄意害人, 怨恨
*that with that child's very first step, and*   ['ʃi:ld] 保护
*each step after that, they are separating*	
*from us*; that we won't — that *we can't always*
*be there for them*. They'll suffer sickness	['setbæk]
and *setbacks* and broken hearts and            挫折, 退步, 逆流
disappointments. And we learn that *our most*	[ri'laiәnt]
*important job is to give them what they need*	依赖的, 信赖的
*to become _self-reliant_ and capable and*	[ri'ziliәnt]
*_resilient_, ready to face the world without*  弹回的, 有弹力的
*fear.*                                        【医】 回弹的, 回能的

And we know we can't do this by ourselves. _It
comes as a shock at a certain point where_ you
realize, no matter how much you love these
kids, you can't do it by yourself. That this
job of keeping our children safe, and
teaching them well, is something we can only
do together, with the help of friends and
neighbors, the help of a community, and the
help of a nation. And in that way, we _come to_
realize that we _bear a responsibility_ for
every child because we're _counting on_
everybody else to help look after ours; that
we're all parents; that they're all our
children.

This is our first task — _caring for_ our	take care of
children. It's our first job. If we don't get	try:这里可让人理解：
that right, we don't get anything right.	为什么说美国是
That's how, as a society, we will be judged.	儿童的天堂，为什么校车
						有如此大的优先权？

And *by that measure*, can we _truly_ say, as a		youdao:通过这角度
nation, that we are _meeting our obligations_?
Can we honestly say that we're doing enough
to keep our children — all of them — safe
from harm? Can we _claim_, as a nation, that
we're all together there, letting them know
that they are loved, and teaching them to
love _in return_? Can we say that we're _truly_
doing enough to give all the children of this
country the chance they deserve to live out
their lives in happiness and *with purpose*?	有意义的人生

I've been *reflecting on this* the last few
days, and if we're honest with ourselves, the
answer is NO. We're NOT doing enough. And we
will have to change.

Since I've been President, this is the fourth
time we have come together to _comfort_ a	['kʌmfәt]
*grieving* community torn apart by a *mass* [kәn'sәul]
*shooting*. The fourth time we've hugged          vt. 安慰, 藉慰
survivors. The fourth time we've *consoled* the 【计】 控制台
families of victims. And in between, *there*	['dedli]            
*have been an endless series of _deadly_*       a. 致命的, 致死的
*shootings across the country, almost daily*  ['deili]
*reports of victims, many of them children, in* 本段断续，而又接续的口吻
*small towns and big cities all across America* try:美国的现状，出自
*— victims whose — much of the time, their*	现任美国总统之口
*only fault was being in the wrong place at*	让人震惊
*the wrong time*.

We can't _tolerate_ this anymore. These		['trædʒidi]
*tragedies* must end. And to end them, we must  n. 悲剧, 惨案, 悲剧作品
change. We will be told that the causes of  
such violence are complex, and that is true.
No single law — no set of laws can eliminate
evil from the world, or prevent every
_senseless_ act of violence in our society.

But *that can't be an excuse for inaction*.	[ik'skju:z]
Surely, we can do better than this. If there
is even one step we can take to save another
child, or another parent, or another town,
from the grief that has visited Tucson, and
Aurora, and Oak Creek, and Newtown, and
communities from Columbine to Blacksburg
before that — then surely we have an
obligation to try.

In the coming weeks, I will use whatever
power this office holds to engage my fellow   'engage' ?
citizens — from *law enforcement* to mental	法律实施	
health professionals to parents and educators
— _in an effort aimed at_ preventing more
tragedies like this. Because what choice do
we have? We can't accept events like this as
*routine*. _Are we really prepared_ to say that really极难发音地道
we're powerless in the face of such *carnage*, ['kɑ:nidʒ]大屠杀, 残杀
that the politics are too hard? Are we          ['pɒlitiks]
prepared to say that such violence visited on	西方国家民主和自由的代价
our children year after year after year is	民众反对禁枪，政府没辙
_somehow_ the _price of_ our freedom?		不知何故

All the world's religions — so many of them	try:畅谈（哲学意义上）
represented here today — start with a simple	的人生，说的真好
question: Why are we here? _What gives our
life meaning? What gives our acts purpose?_ We
know our time on this Earth is *fleeting*. We	疾驰的, 短暂的, 飞逝的
know that we will each have our share of	想起一词儿：人生...如白驹过隙
pleasure and pain; that even after we _chase
after_ some _earthly goal_, whether it's _wealth_
or _power_ or _fame_, or just simple comfort, we
will, in some fashion, *fall short of* what we	达不到；缺乏
had hoped. We know that no matter how good	['stʌmbl]
our intentions [try+: are], we will all *stumble* 绊倒, 蹒跚而行
sometimes, in some way. We will make            使困惑,失策, 犯错
mistakes, we will experience _hardships_. And
even when we're trying to do the right thing,
we know that much of our time will be spent
*groping through the darkness*, so often unable	摸索,"路漫漫...吾将上下而求索"
to *discern* God's *heavenly* plans.		认识, 洞悉 天上的, 神圣的

世上所有的宗教信仰--今天有很多的代表也在这里 --
都是起源于一个简单的疑问：我们为什么会在这里？我们生命的意义是什么？我们行动的
目的是什么？我们知道人生如梦幻泡影，转瞬即逝我们知道我们每个人都有在这尘世的苦
乐即便我们追逐世俗的名声，财富，权力，或者就只是舒适，我们必定会以某种方式得非
所愿不管我们本来的意图如何，我们总会在某些时候，以某种方式，步履艰难我们会经历
磨难即便我们想做正确的事，我们知道我们大部分时间，都仍将在黑暗中摸索，常常无法

There's only one thing *we can be sure of*, and
that is the love that we have — for our
children, for our families, for each other.
The warmth of a small child's embrace — that	 [wɔ:mθ] 美语+r,注意θ音  拥抱
is true. The memories we have of them, the
joy that they bring, the wonder we see		[fiәs]a. 凶猛的, 猛烈的, 
through their eyes, that *fierce* and boundless   热烈的, 暴躁的
love we feel for them, a love that takes us     ['baundlis]
out of ourselves, and binds us to something     a. 无限的, 无边无际的
larger — we know that's what matters. We know
we're always doing right when we're taking
care of them, when we're teaching them well,
when we're showing acts of kindness. We don't
go wrong when we do that.

That's what we can be sure of. And that's
what you, the people of Newtown, have
reminded us. That's how you've inspired us.
You remind us what matters. And that's what
should _drive us forward in everything we do_,
for _as long as God sees fit to keep us on_	"all the time"的诗意表达
_this Earth_.

"Let the little children come to me," Jesus	['hindә]

God has called them all home. For those of us
who remain, let us find the strength to carry
on, and make our country worthy of their
memory.

May God bless and keep those we've lost in	try:祈祷的常用句式
His heavenly place. May He grace those we
still have with His holy comfort. And may He
bless and watch over this community, and the
United States of America. (Applause.)
