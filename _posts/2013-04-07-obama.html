<strong>Scripture</strong> tells us: <strong>"...do not lose heart.</strong>  n. 圣经, 圣经的一节
<strong>Though <em>outwardly</em> we are <em>wasting away</em></strong>      表面上, 在外, 外表上

<strong>what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen</strong> [,ʌn'sin]
<strong>is eternal. For we know that if the earthly</strong>
<strong>tent we live in is destroyed, we have a</strong>
<strong>building from God, an eternal house in</strong>
<strong>heaven, not built by human hands."</strong>

We gather here <em>in memory of</em> twenty beautiful
children and six remarkable adults. They lost
their lives in a school that <em>could have been</em> 记得课本里说的"虚拟语气"？
any school; in a quiet town full of good and
decent people that <em>could be</em> any town in
America.

Here in Newtown, I come to offer the love and   [prєә, 'preiә]
<strong>prayers</strong> of a nation. I am very <strong>mindful</strong> that 祈祷, 祷辞, 祈祷者
<em>mere</em> words cannot match the depths of your   ['maidful]
<strong>sorrow</strong>, nor can they heal your <em>wounded</em>       a. 深切注意的,

And you must know that <em>whatever measure</em> of
comfort we can provide, we will provide;
whatever portion of sadness that we can share
with you to <strong>ease this heavy load,</strong> we will     【常用词】
gladly <em>bear</em> it.  Newtown — you are not alone.

As these difficult days have <strong>unfolded</strong>, you've
also inspired us with stories of strength and
<strong>resolve</strong> and sacrifice. We know that when      决定之事, 决心, 坚决
danger arrived in the halls of Sandy Hook
Elementary, the school's staff did not          [flintʃ]

<pre><code>We know that there were other teachers who      [,bæri'keid]
<strong>barricaded</strong> themselves inside classrooms, and  设路障于, 阻碍

their students by saying "wait for the good     keep steady

to do, and others needed them more.             【医】 创伤, 外伤

And then there were the scenes of the
schoolchildren, helping one another, holding
each other, <strong>dutifully</strong> following instructions  悲痛的演讲，还能穿插玩笑？
in the way that young children sometimes do;    (try:Laughter.)
one child even trying to encourage a <strong>grown-up</strong> 成年人
by saying, "I know <strong>karate</strong>. So it's okay. I'll [kә'rɑ:ti]
<em>lead the way out</em>."                            n. 空手道

As a community, you've inspired us, Newtown.    [,indi'skraibәbl]
<em>In the face of</em> <strong>indescribable</strong> violence, in the 不能用语言表达的,
face of <strong>unconscionable</strong> evil, you've looked    不可名状的, 莫名其妙的
out for each other, and you've cared for one    [,ʌn'kɒnʃәnәbl]
another, and you've loved one another.  This    a. 不受良心支配的,
is how Newtown will be remembered. And with     不合理的, 过度的
time, and God's grace, that love will <em>see you</em> 有道：看穿
<em>through</em>.

But we, as a nation, we are left with some
hard questions. Someone once described the
joy and <strong>anxiety</strong> of <strong>parenthood</strong> as the        [æŋ'zaɪəti] `ŋ` 要发出
<em>equivalent of</em> having your heart outside of    ['preʃәs] 等价`物`(not ..ence)
your body all the time, walking around. With    a. 宝贵的, 珍贵的,
their very first cry, this most <strong>precious</strong>,     过于精致的, 珍爱的
vital part of ourselves — our child — is
suddenly exposed to the world, to possible      ['mis,hæp]
<strong>mishap</strong> or <strong>malice</strong>. And every parent knows    n. 不幸之事, 灾祸, 恶运
there is nothing we will not do to <strong>shield</strong> our ['mælis]
children from harm. And yet, <strong>we also know</strong>     恶意, 蓄意害人, 怨恨
<strong>that with that child's very first step, and</strong>   ['ʃi:ld] 保护
<strong>each step after that, they are separating</strong>
<strong>from us</strong>; that we won't — that <strong>we can't always</strong>
<strong>be there for them</strong>. They'll suffer sickness    ['setbæk]
and <strong>setbacks</strong> and broken hearts and            挫折, 退步, 逆流
disappointments. And we learn that <strong>our most</strong>   [ri'laiәnt]

<strong>to become <em>self-reliant</em> and capable and</strong>      [ri'ziliәnt]

<h2><a name="_part_iii"></a>3. part III</h2>
<pre><code>And we know we can't do this by ourselves. <em>It
comes as a shock at a certain point where</em> you
realize, no matter how much you love these
kids, you can't do it by yourself. That this
job of keeping our children safe, and
teaching them well, is something we can only
do together, with the help of friends and
neighbors, the help of a community, and the
help of a nation. And in that way, we <em>come to</em>
realize that we <em>bear a responsibility</em> for
every child because we're <em>counting on</em>
everybody else to help look after ours; that
we're all parents; that they're all our
children.

This is our first task — <em>caring for</em> our     take care of
children. It's our first job. If we don't get   try:这里可让人理解：
that right, we don't get anything right.        为什么说美国是
That's how, as a society, we will be judged.    儿童的天堂，为什么校车
                                                有如此大的优先权？

And <strong>by that measure</strong>, can we <em>truly</em> say, as a         youdao:通过这角度
nation, that we are <em>meeting our obligations</em>?
Can we honestly say that we're doing enough
to keep our children — all of them — safe
from harm? Can we <em>claim</em>, as a nation, that
we're all together there, letting them know
that they are loved, and teaching them to
love <em>in return</em>? Can we say that we're <em>truly</em>
doing enough to give all the children of this
country the chance they deserve to live out
their lives in happiness and <strong>with purpose</strong>?    有意义的人生

I've been <strong>reflecting on this</strong> the last few
days, and if we're honest with ourselves, the
answer is NO. We're NOT doing enough. And we
will have to change.

Since I've been President, this is the fourth
time we have come together to <em>comfort</em> a       ['kʌmfәt]
<strong>grieving</strong> community torn apart by a <strong>mass</strong> [kәn'sәul]
<strong>shooting</strong>. The fourth time we've hugged          vt. 安慰, 藉慰
survivors. The fourth time we've <strong>consoled</strong> the 【计】 控制台
families of victims. And in between, <strong>there</strong>    ['dedli]
<strong>have been an endless series of <em>deadly</em></strong>       a. 致命的, 致死的
<strong>shootings across the country, almost daily</strong>  ['deili]
<strong>reports of victims, many of them children, in</strong> 本段断续，而又接续的口吻
<strong>small towns and big cities all across America</strong> try:美国的现状，出自
<strong>— victims whose — much of the time, their</strong> 现任美国总统之口
<strong>only fault was being in the wrong place at</strong>    让人震惊
<strong>the wrong time</strong>.</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2><a name="_part_iv"></a>4. part IV</h2>
<pre><code>We can't <em>tolerate</em> this anymore. These         [<em>trædʒidi]
<strong>tragedies</strong> must end. And to end them, we must  n. 悲剧, 惨案, 悲剧作品
change. We will be told that the causes of
such violence are complex, and that is true.
No single law — no set of laws can eliminate
evil from the world, or prevent every
<em>senseless</em> act of violence in our society.

But <strong>that can't be an excuse for inaction</strong>.     [ik'skju:z]
Surely, we can do better than this. If there
is even one step we can take to save another
child, or another parent, or another town,
from the grief that has visited Tucson, and
Aurora, and Oak Creek, and Newtown, and
communities from Columbine to Blacksburg
before that — then surely we have an
obligation to try.

In the coming weeks, I will use whatever
power this office holds to engage my fellow   'engage</em> ?
citizens — from <strong>law enforcement</strong> to mental   法律实施
health professionals to parents and educators
— <em>in an effort aimed at</em> preventing more
tragedies like this. Because what choice do
we have? We can't accept events like this as
<strong>routine</strong>. <em>Are we really prepared</em> to say that really极难发音地道
we're powerless in the face of such <strong>carnage</strong>, ['kɑ:nidʒ]大屠杀, 残杀
that the politics are too hard? Are we          ['pɒlitiks]
prepared to say that such violence visited on   西方国家民主和自由的代价
our children year after year after year is      民众反对禁枪，政府没辙
<em>somehow</em> the <em>price of</em> our freedom?           不知何故

All the world's religions — so many of them   try:畅谈（哲学意义上）
represented here today — start with a simple  的人生，说的真好
question: Why are we here? <em>What gives our
life meaning? What gives our acts purpose?</em> We
know our time on this Earth is <strong>fleeting</strong>. We   疾驰的, 短暂的, 飞逝的
know that we will each have our share of        想起一词儿：人生...如白驹过隙
pleasure and pain; that even after we <em>chase
after</em> some <em>earthly goal</em>, whether it's <em>wealth</em>
or <em>power</em> or <em>fame</em>, or just simple comfort, we
will, in some fashion, <strong>fall short of</strong> what we  达不到；缺乏
had hoped. We know that no matter how good      ['stʌmbl]
our intentions [try+: are], we will all <strong>stumble</strong> 绊倒, 蹒跚而行
sometimes, in some way. We will make            使困惑,失策, 犯错
mistakes, we will experience <em>hardships</em>. And
even when we're trying to do the right thing,
we know that much of our time will be spent
<strong>groping through the darkness</strong>, so often unable 摸索,"路漫漫...吾将上下而求索"
to <strong>discern</strong> God's <strong>heavenly</strong> plans.            认识, 洞悉 天上的, 神圣的

世上所有的宗教信仰--今天有很多的代表也在这里 -- 都是起源于一个简单的疑问：我们
为什么会在这里(why are we here)？我们生命的意义是什么(what gives our life
meaning)？我们行动的目的是什么(what gives our acts purpose)？我们知道人生[如梦
幻泡影](原文无对应），转瞬即逝(fleeting). 我们知道我们每个人都有在这尘世的苦乐
（pleasure and pain,) 即便我们追逐(chase after)世俗的名声，财富，权力，或者就只
是简单你的舒适，我们必定会以某种方式得非所愿(fall short of what we had hoped)。
不管我们本来的意图如何，我们总会在某些时候，以某种方式，步履艰难(stumble)。我们
会经历磨难(hardships)。即便我们想做正确的事，我们知道我们大部分时间，都仍将在黑
暗中摸索，常常无法领会神的天意(God's heavenly plans)。</code></pre>

<pre><code>There's only one thing <strong>we can be sure of</strong>, and
that is the love that we have — for our

The warmth of a small child's embrace — that   [wɔ:mθ] 美语+r,注意θ音  拥抱

<strong>tragedies</strong> must end. And to end them, we must  n. 悲剧, 惨案, 悲剧作品
change. We will be told that the causes of
such violence are complex, and that is true.
No single law — no set of laws can eliminate
evil from the world, or prevent every
<em>senseless</em> act of violence in our society.

But <strong>that can't be an excuse for inaction</strong>.     [ik'skju:z]
Surely, we can do better than this. If there
is even one step we can take to save another
child, or another parent, or another town,
from the grief that has visited Tucson, and
Aurora, and Oak Creek, and Newtown, and
communities from Columbine to Blacksburg
before that — then surely we have an
obligation to try.

In the coming weeks, I will use whatever
power this office holds to engage my fellow   'engage</em> ?
citizens — from <strong>law enforcement</strong> to mental   法律实施
health professionals to parents and educators
— <em>in an effort aimed at</em> preventing more
tragedies like this. Because what choice do
we have? We can't accept events like this as
<strong>routine</strong>. <em>Are we really prepared</em> to say that really极难发音地道
we're powerless in the face of such <strong>carnage</strong>, ['kɑ:nidʒ]大屠杀, 残杀

we know that much of our time will be spent

世上所有的宗教信仰--今天有很多的代表也在这里 -- 都是起源于一个简单的疑问：我们
为什么会在这里(why are we here)？我们生命的意义是什么(what gives our life
meaning)？我们行动的目的是什么(what gives our acts purpose)？我们知道人生[如梦
幻泡影](原文无对应），转瞬即逝(fleeting). 我们知道我们每个人都有在这尘世的苦乐
（pleasure and pain,) 即便我们追逐(chase after)世俗的名声，财富，权力，或者就只
是简单你的舒适，我们必定会以某种方式得非所愿(fall short of what we had hoped)。
不管我们本来的意图如何，我们总会在某些时候，以某种方式，步履艰难(stumble)。我们
会经历磨难(hardships)。即便我们想做正确的事，我们知道我们大部分时间，都仍将在黑
暗中摸索，常常无法领会神的天意(God's heavenly plans)。</code></pre>
