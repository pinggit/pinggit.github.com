The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.</p><p>1:2    我使你以东在列国中为最小的，被人大大藐视。
Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised.</p><p>1:3    住在山穴中，居所在高处的阿，你因狂傲自欺，心里说，谁能将我拉下地去呢。
The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?</p><p>1:4    你虽如大鹰高飞，在星宿之间搭窝，我必从那里拉下你来。这是耶和华说的。
Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.</p><p>1:5    盗贼若来在你那里，或强盗夜间而来，（你何竟被剪除）岂不偷窃直到够了呢。摘葡萄的若来到你那里，岂不剩下些葡萄呢。
If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?</p><p>1:6    以扫的隐密处，何竟被搜寻。他隐藏的宝物何竟被查出。
How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up!</p><p>1:7    与你结盟的，都送你上路，直到交界。与你和好的，欺骗你，且胜过你。与你一同吃饭的，设下网罗陷害你。在你心里毫无聪明。
All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.</p><p>1:8    耶和华说，到那日，我岂不从以东除灭智慧人，从以扫山除灭聪明人。
Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?</p><p>1:9    毯螅哪，你的勇士必惊惶，甚至以扫山的人，都被杀戮剪除。
And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.</p><p>1:10    因你向兄弟雅各行强暴，羞愧必遮盖你，你也必永远断绝。
For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.</p><p>1:11    当外人掳掠雅各的财物，外邦人进入他的城门，为耶路撒冷拈阄的日子，你竟站在一旁，像与他们同夥。
In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.</p><p>1:12    你兄弟遭难的日子，你不当瞪眼看着，犹大人被灭的日子，你不当因此欢乐。他们遭难的日子，你不当说狂傲的话。
But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.</p><p>1:13    我民遭灾的日子，你不当进他们的城门。他们遭灾的日子，你不当瞪眼看着他们受苦。他们遭灾的日子，你不当伸手抢他们的财物。
Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;</p><p>1:14    你不当站在岔路口，剪除他们中间逃脱的。他们遭难的日子，你不当将他们剩下的人交付仇敌。
Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.</p><p>1:15    耶和华降罚的日子临近万国。你怎样行，他也必照样向你行。你的报应必归到你头上。
For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.</p><p>1:16    你们犹大人在我圣山怎样喝了苦杯，万国也必照样常常地喝。且喝且咽，他们就归于无有。
For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.</p><p>1:17    在锡安山必有逃脱的人，那山也必成圣。雅各家必得原有的产业。
But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.</p><p>1:18    雅各家必成为大火，约瑟家必为火焰，以扫家必如碎秸，火必将他烧着吞灭。以扫家必无馀剩的。这是耶和华说的。
And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it.</p><p>1:19    南地的人必得以扫山，高原的人必得非利士地，也得以法莲地，和撒玛利亚地，便雅悯人必得基列。
And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.</p><p>1:20    在迦南人中被掳的以色列众人，必得地直到撒勒法。在西法拉中被掳的耶路撒冷人，必得南地的城邑。
And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south.</p><p>1:21    必有拯救者上到锡安山，审判以扫山，国度就归耶和华了。
And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD’s.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s30.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s32.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
